            <p style="width: 80vw; height: auto; max-width: 95vw; line-height: 1.2rem; margin: 0.7rem 0.6rem;">Welcome to <b>DevTales</b>: The City Where Code Comes to Life.</p>
                
               <p style="width: 80vw; height: auto; max-width: 95vw; line-height: 1.2rem; margin: 0.7rem 0.6rem;"> Greetings, brave reader, and welcome to <b>DevTales</b>! My name is <span>Joseph Keiyuru</span>, and I'm your friendly neighborhood developer on a quest to decode the mysteries of programming, one line at a time. If you're here, you're probably embarking on your own coding journey—or maybe just curious about what drives people to talk to machines all day.
                
                You see, in my world, programming isn't just typing cryptic symbols on a screen; it's a city I'm building from scratch. Picture this: each piece of code is like a blueprint, and each function, class, and component is another structure in the skyline of my developer city. Some days, my city is an architectural marvel; other days, it's a little closer to a chaotic construction site (we've all been there).
                
                In <b>DevTales</b>, you're not just reading a blog—you're stepping into a vibrant city filled with stories about code, debugging woes, and those “aha” moments that make it all worthwhile. I aim to share my journey in a way that's engaging, sometimes funny, and hopefully inspiring, so you can learn (and maybe avoid a few of my mistakes) along the way. Think of it as a mix of coding insights, life lessons, and the occasional detour into “wait, that's how it works?” territory.
                
                Expect stories that break down complex concepts into something manageable—whether it's building a function from the ground up or understanding how JavaScript works like the electrical grid powering my coding city. Each post is like a building block of this city we're creating together, and as <b>DevTales</b> grows, so will your skills, your confidence, and maybe even your sense of adventure.
                
                So whether you're a brand-new coder or a seasoned developer looking to reconnect with the basics, join me here. Let's build something amazing, one <b>DevTale</b> at a time. Welcome to the city where code becomes real.</p>
